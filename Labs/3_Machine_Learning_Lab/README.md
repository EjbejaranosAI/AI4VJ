# ü¶Å Lab Deep Learning - Animal Identification and Educational Game

## Objective  
In this lab, you will design the first phase of a real-time animal identification and educational app using Deep Learning techniques. Inspired by a request from the Luthadel Zoo, the goal is to create an interactive application for children. This lab focuses on implementing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify animals and prepare the data for generating educational questions.

## Setup and Instructions  
Follow these steps to complete the lab:

1. **Photo Upload and Animal Identification**  
   - Simulate the process where a user uploads a photo of an animal using their mobile device.  
   - Train a CNN model to identify which animal is present in the image.  

2. **Dataset**  
   - Use the [Kaggle Animals Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com) (linked in the attached PDF).  
   - Limit the dataset to **10 classes**:
     - Antelope  
     - Bear  
     - Elephant  
     - Jellyfish  
     - Mouse  
     - Turtle  
     - Penguin  
     - Ladybugs  
     - Leopard  
     - Lion  

3. **Deliverables**  
   - **Python Notebook üìì**  
     - Implement and document the CNN model using a Jupyter Notebook.  
     - Include Markdown explanations for each step, from data preparation to model evaluation.  
   - **Explanatory Report üìÑ**  
     - A summary document including:
       - Parameters tested (architecture, learning rate, epochs, batch size).  
       - Results (accuracy, loss, overfitting/underfitting analysis).  
       - Number of models trained and tested, and their performance.

| **CNN Implementation üß†**      | **5**      | Accurate implementation of the CNN for animal classification.                                     |  
| **Model Performance üìà**       | **4**      | Achieves a reasonable level of accuracy without overfitting or underfitting.                      |  
| **Documentation and Code üìÑ**  | **3**      | Clean, well-documented code with clear explanations in the notebook.                              |  
| **Parameter Exploration üîç**   | **3**      | Systematic exploration and reporting of the effects of different parameters (e.g., learning rate). |

## Tips for Success  
- Start the lab early. Training the CNN model, especially on a CPU, may take significant time (1 hour or more).  
- Use **Google Colab** if you don‚Äôt have access to a GPU.  
- Train different models on separate computers or sessions to test various parameter combinations.  
- Focus on clean code and clear documentation, as these are key to achieving full marks.
