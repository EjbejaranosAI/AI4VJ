# Patrolling and Wander Lab 🕵️‍♂️🚶‍♂️

## Objective

In this lab, you will create a Unity scene featuring two agents with different movement behaviors. The goal is to implement and demonstrate patrolling and wandering movements for AI agents.

## Scene Setup

1. **Agents**:
   - **Agent 1 (Patrolling Movement) 🗺️**:
     - Implement patrolling behavior using waypoints.
     - Apply the ghost smoothing technique for smooth transitions.
     - The initial point and direction should be randomly selected.
   
   - **Agent 2 (Wandering Movement) 🌪️**:
     - Implement wandering behavior where the agent moves unpredictably within the scene.

2. **Deliverables**:
   - **Unity Package 📦**: Include the complete Unity project package with your scene and scripts.
   - **Video 📹**: Record a video showcasing the behavior of both agents in the scene.

Ensure that both agents' movements are clearly visible and that the scene demonstrates the implemented behaviors effectively.

Good luck!
